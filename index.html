          <h1>Speak Out Against Drag At Notre Dame</h1>
          <p>The Department of Film, Television, and Theatre is co-sponsoring a drag show at Notre Dame alongside the Department of Music, the Department of American Studies, the Initiative on Race and Resilience, the Gender Studies Program, and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. The event is expected to take place in the Philbin Studio Theatre at the Debartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC) on Friday, November 3rd at 7:30 PM.</p>

          <h1>Protest Information</h1>
          <p>If you are in the South Bend area or you are a part of the Notre Dame community and would like to join in protest of this event, we will be gathering outside of DPAC beginning at 6:15 pm on Friday, November 3rd. Tickets are available for students to pick up an hour before the event at 6:30 pm.</p>
          <p>We strongly encourage those who can to pick up a ticket at the Ticket Office and either enter the blackbox theatre and walk out when the event starts, or not use the ticket (but save a soul from watching the debauchery!)</p>
          <p>At 7:30 pm, we will begin praying the sorrowful mysteries of the rosary outside of DPAC.</p>

        return `Dear Fr. Jenkins, Fr. Gerry, Provost McGreevy, and Administrators,

My name is ${name}, I am a ${relation} of the University of Notre Dame.

I am emailing to express my concern about the drag performance scheduled for November 3 on Notre Dame’s campus with sponsorship by the Notre Dame Department of Film, Television, and Theater, the Department of Music, the Department of American Studies, the Initiative on Race and Resilience, the Gender Studies Program, and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. 

Notre Dame's mission statement declares, “The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake.” Father Jenkins clarified in his remarks on the university’s commitment to the pursuit of truth and academic freedom that “the right of free expression does not, of course, extend to speech that threatens violence or constitutes harassment against an individual or a group. Such expressions violate University policies and will not be tolerated.”

A drag performance of any kind harasses and degrades women, pervading the truth of God’s creation of man and woman. The University’s invitation to three biological males to be paid to come to campus, dress in provocative clothing, mock, and objectify women must be rescinded. We demand the University offer an apology, especially to her women, for ever considering such a degrading portrayal of femininity, and direct its funds to events that support authentic femininity and the dignity of the human person. 

Our Lady’s University has a moral obligation to the truth and protection of her students that absolutely overrides a notion of ‘academic freedom,’ within which a drag performance has no place. This event must not take place under Our Lady’s golden dome. 

I look forward to your response.
In Christ,
${name}`;
