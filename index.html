          <h1>When Drag Came to Notre Dame...</h1>
          <p>The Notre Dame Department of Film, Television, and Theatre co-sponsored a drag show on Friday, November 3rd at 7:30 PM alongside the Department of Music, the Department of American Studies, the Initiative on Race and Resilience, the Gender Studies Program, and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts.</p>
          <p>The Irish Rover first <a href="https://irishrover.net/2023/09/drag-show-planned-at-notre-dame/">reported</a> on this event on September 13th.</p>
          <p>Editor-in-Chief Nico Schmitz followed up this report with an editorial, <a href="https://irishrover.net/2023/11/no-place-for-drag-at-our-ladys-university/"><span class="italic-text">No Place for Drag at Our Lady’s University</span></a> on October 11th, 2023.</p>
          <p>On November 18th, this website was created by senior Jose Rodriguez to provide a platform for those in the Notre Dame family to express their concern for the event and urge administrators to rescind the drag ‘artists’ invitation and direct funds toward supporting authentic femininity and human dignity. The final stats are as follows:</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">158 students</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">493 alumni</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">519 parents and supporters</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">89 donors</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">5 staff or faculty members</p>
          <p class="indented-paragraph">1,264 total emails sent</p>
          <p>On October 24th, seniors Madelyn Stout and Merlot Fogarty published a Letter to The Editor in the Notre Dame Observer speaking out against the drag show entitled: <a href="https://ndsmcobserver.com/2023/10/drag-at-notre-dame-did-we-regild-her-only-to-ridicule-her/"><span class="italic-text">Did we regild her only to ridicule her?</span></a></p>
          <p>News outlets across the country caught wind of the controversy: <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/students-protest-drag-show-planned-catholic-university-notre-dame">Fox News</a>, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255834/notre-dame-students-defend-dignity-and-sanctity-of-women-ahead-of-campus-drag-show">Catholic News Agency</a>, <a href="https://spectator.org/notre-dame-president-defends-drag-shows-on-catholic-campus/">The American Spectator</a>, <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/10/26/notre-dame-admin-defends-university-sponsored-drag-show-under-the-guise-of-academic-freedom/">The Federalist</a>, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/notre-dame-president-defends-school-sponsored-drag-show-on-grounds-of-academic-freedom">The Daily Wire</a>, & <a href="https://ondemand.ewtn.com/free/Home/Play/en/CB20231030">EWTN</a>.</p>
          <p>On November 3, over 250 students, faculty, and community members gathered outside of the Debartolo Performing Arts Center to host a prayer rally and rosary procession to the log chapel where a holy hour was held throughout the time the event took place. Local media (<a href="https://www.abc57.com/news/drag-performance-at-notre-dame-causes-controversy-protests">ABC57</a>, <a href="https://www.wndu.com/2023/11/04/notre-dame-class-highlights-drag-performance-amid-demonstrations/">WNDU</a>) covered the protest as well as the <a href="https://ndsmcobserver.com/2023/11/drag-queens-perform-at-dpac-amid-outrage-and-protest/"><span class="italic-text">Observer</span></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIXcbA1OCUE?si=dRq5DfJ31XY2JQeA">NDTV</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JauMTvV_OqI?si=-sN80gJfXMI6e-ge">TFP</a>. </p>

          <p>Professor Pamela Wojcik, the FTT department chair who brought the drag show to Notre Dame, began her introduction of the event: “Welcome to Notre Dame’s first, and I’m betting last, drag show.”</p>
          <p>To that, we say: praise God. Drag has no place under Our Lady’s golden dome. The prayerful presence of community members kneeling outside the performance was a sight to behold, and truly shows the dedication of Notre Dame students and alumni to truth and the dignity of the human person. Thank you to all who have supported this endeavor. </p>

        return `Dear Fr. Jenkins, Fr. Gerry, Provost McGreevy, and Administrators,

My name is ${name}, I am a ${relation} of the University of Notre Dame.

I am emailing to express my concern about the drag performance scheduled for November 3 on Notre Dame’s campus with sponsorship by the Notre Dame Department of Film, Television, and Theater, the Department of Music, the Department of American Studies, the Initiative on Race and Resilience, the Gender Studies Program, and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. 

Notre Dame's mission statement declares, “The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake.” Father Jenkins clarified in his remarks on the university’s commitment to the pursuit of truth and academic freedom that “the right of free expression does not, of course, extend to speech that threatens violence or constitutes harassment against an individual or a group. Such expressions violate University policies and will not be tolerated.”

A drag performance of any kind harasses and degrades women, pervading the truth of God’s creation of man and woman. The University’s invitation to three biological males to be paid to come to campus, dress in provocative clothing, mock, and objectify women must be rescinded. We demand the University offer an apology, especially to her women, for ever considering such a degrading portrayal of femininity, and direct its funds to events that support authentic femininity and the dignity of the human person. 

Our Lady’s University has a moral obligation to the truth and protection of her students that absolutely overrides a notion of ‘academic freedom,’ within which a drag performance has no place. This event must not take place under Our Lady’s golden dome. 

I look forward to your response.
In Christ,
${name}`;
