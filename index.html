        return `Dear Fr. Jenkins, Fr. Gerry, Provost McGreevy, and Professor Wojcik,

My name is ${name}, I am a ${relation} of the University of Notre Dame.

I am emailing to express my concern about the drag performance that is being held on Notre Dame’s campus on November 3 with sponsorship by the Notre Dame Department of Music, the Department of American Studies, the Initiative on Race and Resilience, the Gender Studies Program, and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. 

Notre Dame's mission statement states, “The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake.” Father Jenkins has also stated in his remarks on the university’s commitment to the pursuit of truth and academic freedom that “the right of free expression does not, of course, extend to speech that threatens violence or constitutes harassment against an individual or a group. Such expressions violate University policies and will not be tolerated.”

A drag performance of any kind harasses and degrades women and pervades the truth of God’s creation of man and woman. The invitation for three biological males to be paid to come to campus to dress in provocative clothing, mock, and objectify women must be rescinded. The university must offer an apology for ever considering such a degrading portrayal of femininity. (should there be a third demand?)

The university’s moral obligation to the truth and protection of her students absolutely overrides a notion of ‘academic freedom,’ of which a drag performance has no place.   

I look forward to your response.
In Christ,
${name}`;
